Basic CRUD operations using Jaggery.js
==============

WSO2 has released Jaggery.js, a framework to compose web apps and HTTP-focused web services in pure JavaScript for all aspects of the application: front-end, communication, Server-side logic and persistence. The framework will reduce the gap between writing client-side web application pages and back-end web services.

In this series of Jaggery.js tutorials, Iâ€™m going to talk about how to perform basic CRUD operations using Jaggery.js.
